## 🔄 App Logic Flow

1. Prompt the user for the **count of numbers** to be used.
2. If the count is **less than 2**, display:
   > ❌ *Invalid input: More than one number is required*
3. Prompt the user to choose the **type of operation mode**:
   - `1. Bulk` – Same operator for all calculations
   - `2. Sequential` – User enters an operator after each number input
4. Based on the selected mode:
   - **Bulk Mode**:
     1. Prompt user to enter **all numbers at once**, separated by commas (e.g., `2,5,7`)
     2. Prompt user to choose an operator (`+`, `-`, etc.)
   - **Sequential Mode**:
     1. Take one number at a time, followed by an operator input (e.g., `2 + 5 - 3`)
5. Perform the calculation and **display the result**.
